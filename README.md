Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using linear regression, a basic yet powerful machine learning algorithm. The aim is to analyze how various features such as house size, number of bedrooms, and location influence the final sale price of a house. I chose linear regression for its simplicity and interpretability, making it a great starting point for understanding relationships between features in the dataset.

Dataset
The dataset contains multiple features related to house listings, including:

Square footage: Total area of the house.
Number of bedrooms: How many bedrooms the house has.
Number of bathrooms: Count of bathrooms.
Location: The region or neighborhood where the house is located.
Other attributes: Additional features like garage size, year built, etc.
I handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling where necessary. Categorical variables such as location were encoded to make them suitable for the linear regression model.

Model Development
I used a linear regression model to predict house prices based on the available features. The steps involved in building the model include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by filling in missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical features.
Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Training: The linear regression algorithm was applied to the training data to find the relationship between the features and the target (house price).
Evaluation: The model was evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Results
R-squared score: [Insert score], which indicates how much variance in house prices is explained by the model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): [Insert value], showing the average squared difference between predicted and actual prices.
These results demonstrate that the model can predict house prices with a reasonable level of accuracy. However, further improvements could be made by adding more features or using advanced algorithms.

Challenges Faced
Feature Selection: Deciding which features to include in the model required careful analysis to avoid overfitting.
Handling Outliers: Some extreme house prices skewed the data, so I applied techniques to handle outliers effectively.
Model Performance: While the model performs well on average, certain features may have more non-linear relationships with house prices that linear regression can't fully capture.
Future Enhancements
Feature Engineering: Adding more granular location data (e.g., zip code-level information) or incorporating external factors like interest rates could improve the model's accuracy.
Advanced Algorithms: Trying more complex models such as Decision Trees or Gradient Boosting could enhance predictive performance.
